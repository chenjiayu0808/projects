# Project 2: Vinyl Resale Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This project explores data gathered from Discogs.com and the Spotify API to find the features of an album that have the most importance in determination of resale price.  These features were then put into several Linear Regression models to determine the model with the most predictive power.

This repo includes 5 files:

- Data_Gathering.ipynb: My code for gathering the feature and target variables from Discogs.com.
- Spotify_API.ipynb: My code for pulling artist popularity data using the Spotify_API
- Vinyl_Data_Cleaning.ipynb: Includes code for Cleaning my dataset and Exploratory Data Analysis on my features.
- Modeling.ipynb: Includes code for all regression models tested on the data as well as feature engineering and transformations.
- Project_Slides.pptx: Final project slides overviewing analysis and results.
