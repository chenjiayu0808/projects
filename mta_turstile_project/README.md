# Project 1: Exploring MTA Turnstile Data

This project explores MTA Turnstile Data to find the most trafficked stations and the time periods in which to optimally advertise for an event.

This repo includes 3 files:

- **MTA_Turnstile_Data.ipynb:** My group's final code that gathers, cleans, and analyzes MTA turnstile data to find top 20 most heavily trafficked stations.
- **NYC Census.ipynb:** My final code that explores NYC Census data to find top 10 stations in areas with target demographics.
- **ProjectSlides.pptx:** Final project slides overviewing analysis and conclusions
